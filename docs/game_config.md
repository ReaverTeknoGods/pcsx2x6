# game config

Since the execution of arcade games consists on the interaction with several files (a main executable, a disc/HDD image and a memory card image). the system2x6 games will be executed via a special per-game settings file

this files provide all the information the emulator needs to setup the enviroment and run that game

the file uses the INI format, and the extension must be `.acgame`

here's an example of how it should look like in the inside

```ini
[game]
name=SoulCalibur II (SC21 vA10 + DVD0D)
gameid=NM00007
platform=246
[data]
elf=boot.elf 
dongle=NM00007 SC21, Ver.A10 a025781148773a.bin
card=ConquestCard0.bin
mediasrc=dvd0.img
media=DVD
```

data    | **elf**   | string         | elf filename to be executed _(must be at the same location than config file)_
data    | **dongle**| string         | security dongle filename _(must be at the `dongles` folder of PCSX2x6)_

data    | sram  | string  | filename for the SRAM settings. if not found, defaults to `sram.bin`


### `platform`
this command tells the emulator if it should emulate the overclock of the System256 (and SUPER256)
so don't forget to include it on games from those platforms

### `elf`
the elf file mentioned on the `elf` entry must be either the decrypted boot.bin file from the security dongle contents, or the open source bootloader: [Proverb](https://github.com/PS2Homebrew-arcade/proverb/)
the [latest release of proverb](https://github.com/PS2Homebrew-arcade/proverb/releases/download/nightly/proverb.zip) already has a well organized structure so you can download and grab the binaries you need for each game

### `256Region`
NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
